Hi there! 👋 😊

I'm Camelia, a passionate automation enthusiast with a strong focus on organization. I create user-friendly PowerShell scripts to help people streamline their routine and boost their productivity. 🚀

## What I'm working on
I'm constantly working on new PowerShell projects to help people automate their daily tasks. You can find all of my projects in my [GitHub profile repositories](https://github.com/CameliaD?tab=repositories), including scripts for file organization, task management, and much more. 

## How to use my scripts
All of my scripts come with detailed instructions on how to use them. Whether you're new to PowerShell or an experienced user, my scripts are designed to be easy to use and customizable to fit your specific needs. 

## Support me
If you find my scripts helpful, please consider sponsoring me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/CameliaD). Your support will allow me to continue creating more useful and user-friendly PowerShell scripts. 🙏

## Availability for freelancing
I'm currently available for part-time freelancing projects with a focus on Microsoft technologies, especially PowerShell, Active Directory, Azure, Office 365, and Intune. If you're interested in working with me, please feel free to reach out via email at camelia.bobaru@gmail.com. 💼
